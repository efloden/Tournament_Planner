# DW Tournament Planner

This project from [Udacityâ€™s Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd004) is a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions) in tournament.sql, and writing code that will use it to track a Swiss tournament in tournament.py.
